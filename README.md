## Intro

Recently, i've found myself working more with Windows machines and by extension Command Prompt.

Many times, i'd want to run a command I know well in `linux` but not quite on `cmd`. It would often take me betweeen a few seconds and sometimes minutes trying to find the right command online which I've found frustrating :rage:

I thought to put this project together for `linux` oriented engineers who might be in similar shoes. Hope you enjoy and possibly find this time saving!

You can [visit the website here](https://linux2cmd.netlify.app/) to get going! :rocket:
