## Intro

Recently, i've found myself working more with VM's running on Microsoft Windows OS and as such, have intereacted greater with Command Prompt `cmd`.

Many times, i'd want to run a command that I know in `linux` but not on `cmd`. It would often take me anywhere betweeen a few seconds and minutes to find the right command which I found frustrating at times :rage:

I thought to build this project to help more `linux` oriented engineers potentially save time. Hope you enjoy and possibly find this useful!
