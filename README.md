## Intro

Recently, i've found myself working a lot more with Windows machines and by extension Command Prompt.

Many times, i'd want to run a `linux` command but not know what it is on `cmd`. Searching for the right command online often takes me a few seconds to sometimes minutes - which I've found frustrating :angry:.

I thought to put this project together for other `linux` oriented users who might be in a similar situation. Hope you enjoy and possibly find this useful!

You can [visit the website here](https://linux2cmd.netlify.app/) to get going! :rocket:
