## Intro

In recent times, I found myself having to work with VM's running on Microsoft Windows OS and as such, have intereacted more with Command Prompt (the default command-line interpreter for MS Windows) than I ever have before. 

Many times, i'd want to run command that I know in linux but not so well on cmd. It would often take me minutes googling the right equivalent cmd command and that frustrated me :rage:.

I thought to build this in order to help myself and more linux oriented engineers save some productive time. 

Hope you enjoy and possibly even find this useful!
