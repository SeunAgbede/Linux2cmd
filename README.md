## Intro

In recent times, I found myself having to work with VM's running on Microsoft Windows OS and as such, have intereacted a lot more with Command Prompt (cmd) - the default command-line interpreter for MS Windows. 

Many times, i'd want to run a command that I know in `linux` but not on `cmd`. It would often take me minutes googling the right equivalent `cmd` command and that frustrated me... a lot :rage:.

I thought to build to help more `linux` oriented engineers like myself save some time. Hope you enjoy and possibly even find this useful.

Staying true to the designer in me :v: :sparkles:

Below is a mock up of what I originally intended but as always, some details changed while building.
